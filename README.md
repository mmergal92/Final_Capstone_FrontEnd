#### About this Project
For this project, I created a client portal. It would allow my agency to have a place to keep all client files and communication in one place.

#### General App features
User can login to delete or create their own comments or projects. This allows me to keep monitor who is logged in and how comments can be edited. 

There is a comment component where users can leave comments about the project and if anything needs to be done. 

The app also includes Google authentication. 

#### Tech features

Node.JS
Express
MongoDB Atlas
Mongoose
React
Figma API


#### Challenges
I faced a few challenges while completing this project. I had several bugs with setting up the heroku and netflify that I had to work through. The client page has several features that are still in progress. I'm still working on the status tracker and hoping to have it update for different projects automatically. I also still need to work on the edit button for the actions column of the comment feature so that only whoever is logged in can edit their comment. 

#### Stretch Goals
I would like to expand on the client page so that it can include deadlines for componenets of a project. I would build new schemas to elaborate on project details and join it to specific client information so that both the client and the agency can have more details on the project.
